## MALL CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION

Customer segmentation is important for businesses to understand their target audience. Different advertisements can be curated and sent to different audience segments based on their demographic profile, interests, and affluence level.

### In this project, you will do the following:

1. Data pre-processing for K-Means clustering
2. Building a K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch
3. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of a clustering model
4. Visualizing clusters built
5. Interpretation and analysis of clusters built

## Conclusion
1. We have successfully built a K-Means clustering model for customer segmentation. We also explored cluster interpretation, and analyzed the behaviour of individuals in each cluster.
2. Finally, we took a look at some business recommendations that could be provided based on the attributes of each individual in the cluster.
